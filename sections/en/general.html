	<h2>General Practices</h2>
	
	<h3>Readability vs Compression</h3>
	
	<p>We prefer readability over file-size savings when it comes to maintaining existing files. Plenty of whitespace is encouraged, along with ASCII art, where appropriate. There is no need for any developer to purposefully compress HTML or CSS, nor obfuscate JavaScript.</p>
	
	<p>We will use server-side or build processes to automatically minify and gzip all static client-side files, such as CSS and JavaScript.</p>
